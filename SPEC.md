# lal spec
`lal` is a simple command line tool that works on folders with a valid `manifest.json`, and accepts the following commands:

- [`lal install`](#lal-install-components) - install dependencies from `manifest.json` into `INPUT`
- [`lal status`](#lal-status) - print current installed dependencies with origin
- [`lal build [name]`](#lal-build-name) - run canonical build in current directory
- [`lal shell`](#lal-shell) - enter container environment mounting `$PWD`
- [`lal stash name`](#lal-stash-name) - copies current `OUTPUT` to cache
- `lal update-manifest`
- [`lal verify`](#lal-verify) - verify manifest validity + verify flat lockfile dependency tree

## Manifest
A per-repo file. Format looks like this (here annotated with illegal comments):

```json
{
  "name": "libwebsockets",  // name of repo
  "version": 10,            // corresponds to latest tag
  "components": ["$1"],     // list of components (used if more than one)
  "scripts": {              // canonical build + test scripts for repo
    "build": "./BUILD $1 $2",
    "test": "./BUILD $1-unit-tests $2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ciscossl": 42
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "gtest": 42
  }
}
```

## Lockfile
A per-build file auto-generated by `lal build` and will reduce the lockfiles generated from dependencies to provide aggregated information.

```json
{
  "name": "monolith",
  "date": "datestring",
  "commit": "sha",
  "container": {
    "name": "edonusdevelopers/centos_build",
    "version": "sha"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "ciscossl": {
      "target": "ncp.amd64",
      "version": 6,
      "order": "global"
    },
    "libwebsockets": {
      "target": "ncp.amd64",
      "version": 5,
      "order": "global",
      "dependencies": {
        "ciscossl": {
          "target": "ncp.amd64",
          "version": 6,
          "order": "global"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "dev": {
    "gtest": {
      "version": 42
    }
  }
}
```

## .lalrc
Per machine configuration file from `lal configure`.

```json
{
  "target": "ncp.amd64",
  "container": "edonusdevelopers/centos_build",
  "cache": "~/.lal/cache",
  "registry": "https://artifactory.wherever"
}
```

## Caching
The local cache is populated when doing installs from the registry, when building locally and stashing them, or when linking them directly.

```sh
~/.lal/cache $ tree .
.
├── globals
│   └── ncp.amd64
│       └── ciscossl
│           └── 6
│               ├── ciscossl.tar.gz
│               └── lockfile.json
└── stash
    └── ncp.amd64
        └── ciscossl
            └── asan
                ├── ciscossl.tar.gz
                └── lockfile.json
```

Sources:

- `globals` are unpacked straight from the registry
- `stash` are tarballs of OUTPUT of builds when doing `lal stash <name>`


### Common Command Specification
#### lal status
Provides list of dependencies currently installed.
If they are not in the manifest they will be listed as _extraneous_.
If they are modified (not a global fetch) they will be listed as _modified_.

#### lal build [name]
Runs the `scripts.build` shell script in the manifest file inside the configured container.

E.g. `"build": "./BUILD $1 $2"` key in the manifest under `scripts` will cause `lal build dme` to run `./BUILD dme ncp.amd64` in the configured container.
If no positional argument (name) is set, it will assume the repository name and do the canonical build.

`lal build` will run `lal verify` and warn if this fails, but proceed anyway. The warning is a developer notice that the build will not be identical on jenkins due to local modifications and should not be ignored indefinitely.

The `lal build` step will generate `OUTPUT/lockfile.json`. For local builds, this generated lockfile may be inconsistent (or wrong). However, this will fail the build on jenkins.

Jenkins will run `lal verify` to ensure it passes anyway.

#### lal install [components..]
Comes in two variants.

 - *lal install [--dev]*: fetches versions corresponding to the manifest from the registry and puts them into `INPUT`. The optional `--dev` flag will also cause `devDependencies` to be installed.

 - *lal install component=version [--save]*: fetches a specific version. The optional `--save` flag will also update the manifest file locally.

The specific version is either a number corresponding to the last tag, or it's a name corresponding to something in `stash` (see `lal stash`). Without a specific version, the latest version is installed.

### Uncommon/Advanced/Internal Command Specification
#### lal shell
Enters an interactive shell in the container listed in `.lalrc` mounting the current directory.

Useful for experimental builds with stuff like `bcm` and `opts`.
Assumes you have run `lal install` or equivalent so that `INPUT` is ready for this.

Should run:

```sh
docker run \
  -v $HOME/.gitconfig:/home/lal/.gitconfig \
  -v $PWD:/home/lal/root \
  -w /home/lal/root \
  --net host \
  --cap-add SYS_NICE \
  --user lal \
  -it $LALCONTAINER \
  /bin/bash
```

You may just have your own wrapper for this anyway, but this is the canonical one. You can not use `lal` inside the container (right?).

#### lal stash <name>
Stashes the current `OUTPUT` folder to in `~/.lal/cache/stash/${target}/${component}/${NAME}` for future reuse. This can be installed into another repository with `lal install component=name`

#### lal verify
Verifies that:

- `manifest.json` exists in `$PWD`
- `manifest.json` is valid json.
- dependencies in `INPUT` match `manifest.json`.
- the dependency tree is flat.
- `INPUT` contains only global dependencies.

#### lal configure
Interactively configures:

- target to inject into `install` and `build` (default: ncp.amd64)
- docker container to use for `build` (default: edonusdevelopers/centos_build)
- registry to use (default: https://artifactory.wherever)
- cache directory to use (default: ~/.lal/cache)
- cache size warning (default: 5G)

To get defaults use `yes "" | lal configure`.

#### lal deploy
Run `scripts.deploy` in manifest in container.

#### lal test
Run `script.test` in manifest in container.

### Universal Options

- `--help` or `-h`
